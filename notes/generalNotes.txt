createEditRoom.php is the location where we will need to implement the "Limit Reservations" checkbox

	

ISSUE:
	PHP is being silly with strings on passing the name of the user into the function
	
	
	
TODO:
	Add ajax to call the php function
		We will need to move the php function to a new separate file, otherwise it gets messy with ajax
		With a separate php file for the php function (NOT saveChanges, that one is fine), we can easily make the ajax call
	
	Get Modal to show up in the event of an SQL error (if the user doesn't exist in the tables)
	Get Modal to show up to verify that a user was added? Deleted?
	
	




IMPORTANT:
    When working with the Production version, we need to update the database to the specifications in cs455.sql
