createEditRoom.php is the location where we will need to implement the "Limit Reservations" checkbox

CreateReservation.php -> processReservation() holds the key to enforcing the limit possibly maybe hopefully?



	buttonhtml = "<button id='ConfirmDeleteUser' class='modal-button btn btn-success' >Delete</button><button class='modal-button btn btn-danger' onclick='closeModal()'>Cancel</button>"
	showMessageBox("Are you sure you want to delete this user?", "Confirm", buttonhtml, false);
	// to pass data, we have to use an anon function.
	document.getElementById('ConfirmDeleteUser').onclick = function() {
		closeModal();
		createClicked(data);
	};
  



IMPORTANT:
    When working with the Production version, we need to update the database to the specifications in cs455.sql
