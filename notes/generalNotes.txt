ISSUE:
	-How do we call a PHP file in a bash file?
		-Maybe we're thinking of it all wrong
		-Maybe we have to call the .sh file from a php file?
		
	-May need to use Perl instead of .SH file to do everything
		-Per Dr. Crabtree, this would likely work better
		
		
	-To do auto time, use CRON to run shell script every so often
	
	
TODO:
	-Add the course number (including subject) in the "reservations" table so that we can work with it with the
	ARGOS auto imported classes so that we can distinguish unique ones.
		-This will mean adding a "Course Number" field when the user makes a reservation. It can either be optional
		or we can default it to blank/null/empty
	-Possibly have a <select> box with each course number to filter the results
	
	-Add sort functionality to sort by either Class number OR by Room number based on what the user wants
		-Could have both called, and use jQuery to change based on a radio button or something like that
		
		
	
	
Note:
	



IMPORTANT:
    -When working with the Production version, we need to update the database to the specifications in cs455.sql
