createEditRoom.php is the location where we will need to implement the "Limit Reservations" checkbox




	buttonhtml = "<button id='ConfirmDeleteUser' class='modal-button btn btn-success' >Delete</button><button class='modal-button btn btn-danger' onclick='closeModal()'>Cancel</button>"
	showMessageBox("Are you sure you want to delete this user?", "Confirm", buttonhtml, false);
	// to pass data, we have to use an anon function.
	document.getElementById('ConfirmDeleteUser').onclick = function() {
		closeModal();
		createClicked(data);
	};
	
	

ISSUE:
	On add user to whitelist, the modal box will pop up momentarily, but then the page will refresh for whatever reason
	PHP is also being silly with strings on passing the name of the user into the function
	
	
	
TODO:
	Get Modal to show up on the add user
	Get Modal to show up in the event of an SQL error (if the user doesn't exist in the tables)
	Get Modal to show up to verify that a user was added? Deleted?
	




IMPORTANT:
    When working with the Production version, we need to update the database to the specifications in cs455.sql
