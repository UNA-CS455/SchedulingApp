To use this sql dump, load xampp or whatever mariadb/sql environment you are running. Either copy all text from 
cs455.sql and paste it into the terminal where you are launching sql commands, or if you are using xammp, simply
navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and find the "import" button where you can browse for cs455.sql and it will
then run the commands in the file.

Godspeed.
