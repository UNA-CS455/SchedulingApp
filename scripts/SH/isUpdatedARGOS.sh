# Things to know beforehand:
#     1) YYYYSemester_course_info.csv holds the course info for that semester of YYYY
#         (for example, 2018Fall_course_info.csv)
# 
#     2) That file is from ARGOS, and is given to the server from ITS
#     3) The current ARGOS file will be named YYYYSemester_course_info_old.csv
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Flow of the ARGOS auto import, generalized so that it is the same for Server and Local testing
#     1) Recieve the new file from ITS directly into the home directory
#     2) Check if any changes have been made
#     3) If not, exit. Else, separate the data into old and new changes
#     4) Delete old data, insert new data
#     5) Remove old ARGOS CSV file, rename new CSV file to 2018YYYYSemester_course_info_old.csv (******TODO!*******)
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Relevant files:
#   parseCSVinsert.php : Converts our CSV files to a usable format, then inserts the data into the database
#   parseCSVdelete.php : Same as insert, but it deletes
#   unique_to_old.csv  : Holds the CSV data on items unique to the old version of the ARGOS report
#   unique_to_new.csv  : Same as old, but it holds the new data
