# Things to know beforehand:
#     1) course_info.csv holds the "new" ARGOS report information. course_info_old.csv holds the
#          old course information
# 
#     2) That file is from ARGOS, and is given to the server from ITS 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Flow of the ARGOS auto import, generalized so that it is the same for Server and Local testing
#     1) Receive the new file from ITS directly into the home directory
#     2) Check if any changes have been made
#     3) If not, exit. Else, separate the data into old and new changes
#     4) Delete old data, insert new data
#     5) Remove old ARGOS CSV file, rename new CSV file to course_info_old.csv 
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Relevant files:
#   parseCSVinsert.php : Converts our CSV files to a usable format, then inserts the data into the database
#   parseCSVdelete.php : Same as insert, but it deletes
#   unique_to_old.csv  : Holds the CSV data on items unique to the old version of the ARGOS report
#   unique_to_new.csv  : Same as old, but it holds the new data
